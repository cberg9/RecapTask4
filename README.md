# RecapTask4
This is an extended version of my previous "SimpleHibernate". Two more models are implemented: (Factory, OmpaManager).
The items of candy that are produced by each factory is recorded. The same item of candy can be produced in many different factories.
A factory also has a manager and they are currently only assigned to a single factory.
